# ELI5: MCP Server Selector 🚦

## What is this project? 🤔

Imagine you have a **magic computer helper** that can do different things depending on where it lives! 

This project is like a **remote control** for your computer that lets you choose which "house" your magic helper should live in.

## The Three Houses 🏠

Your magic helper can live in three different houses:

1. **🖥️ LOCAL House (Green)** - This is like your helper living in your own bedroom! It's safe, close, and perfect for playing and testing things.

2. **🧪 DEV House (Orange)** - This is like your helper living at your friend's house where you go to practice and try new games together.

3. **🚀 PROD House (Red)** - This is like your helper living at the fancy grown-up office where all the important work happens!

## How does it work? ⚡

1. **The Magic Button**: There's a special button at the bottom of your computer screen that shows you which house your helper is currently in.

2. **Click to Switch**: When you click this button, it's like telling your helper "Go to a different house!" 

3. **The Helper Moves**: Your helper packs up their special instructions (we call these "config files") and moves to the new house.

4. **Different Colors**: Each house has its own color so you always know where your helper is:
   - Green = Safe home house 🟢
   - Orange = Practice house 🟠  
   - Red = Important work house 🔴

## What happens when you switch houses? 🔄

Think of it like this: Your helper has three different backpacks (one for each house), and each backpack has different tools inside!

- When your helper goes to the **LOCAL house**, they grab the green backpack with toys and simple tools
- When they go to the **DEV house**, they grab the orange backpack with practice tools
- When they go to the **PROD house**, they grab the red backpack with grown-up work tools

## Why is this useful? 🎯

Just like how you use different toys in different places:
- You play with blocks at home
- You use crayons at school  
- You use fancy computer games at the arcade

Your computer helper needs different tools in different places too! This remote control makes it super easy to switch between them.

## The Magic Trick ✨

The coolest part is that your helper automatically knows which backpack to use based on which house you send them to. You don't have to remember which tools go where - the remote control does all the thinking for you!

So when you click the magic button, you're basically saying:
"Helper, please go to the [GREEN/ORANGE/RED] house and grab the right backpack!"

And *POOF* ✨ - your helper moves there instantly and starts using the right tools!

## In Grown-Up Words 👨‍💻

This is a VS Code extension that helps developers switch between different MCP (Model Context Protocol) server environments by:
- Showing a status bar indicator with environment icons and colors
- Copying the appropriate configuration file when switching environments  
- Integrating with Cursor IDE to update MCP server connections
- Making environment management simple and visual

But remember - it's really just a fancy remote control for your computer helper! 🎮
